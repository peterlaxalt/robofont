<h1>word-o-mat v2.2</h1>

<p>(Apr 13, 2015)</p>
<p>word-o-mat is an extension for RoboFont that generates words for use in type sketching, spacing, testing etc., displaying them directly in the Space Center (or in the Output Window if no font is open).</p>
<p>If you find any bugs or have suggestions for future development, please either fix them or <a href="mailto:nina@typologic.nl">send me a line</a>. Help is especially also welcome for the word lists; many of them come from open sources like movie subtitles, and contain errors and stray English words or proper names.</p>
<p>The code is published under an MIT license; please also see the licensing terms of the enclosed word lists.</p>

<h2>Interface Elements</h2> 

<p><strong>Word Count</strong></p>
<p>Specify the number of words that should be generated. (Be advised that using large numbers significantly slows down performance of the Space Center.)</p>

<p><strong>Word Length</strong></p>
<p>Set minimal and maximal length of created words. Both these numbers are inclusive: Specifying 3 and 5 will yield three, four and five letter words.<br />
</p>

<p><strong>Language/Source</strong></p>
<p>Out of the box, word-o-mat supports 17 languages: besides a quite large English crossword solvers&rsquo; word list it comes with shorter word lists for Catalan, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Latin, Norwegian, Polish, Slovak, Spanish and Vietnamese syllables; more languages continue to be added. There is also an option to use the built-in OSX dictionary, and one to use words from any of the available languages (caution: this will slow down things, as word-o-mat will need to process a six-digit number of words).<br />You can also use a custom word list; this needs to be a .txt file with words on separate lines, using UTF-8 encoding. The script will disregard any lines that contain spaces.<br />
</p>

<p><strong>Case</strong></p>
<p>Select whether you want to look at words as they are provided, or converted to all lowercase, all uppercase, or with their first letter capitalized.<br />Please note that the words get processed <em>before</em> matching required letters: Thus if you&rsquo;re looking for all-cap words with the letter <em>A/a</em> in it, you need to specify <em>A</em> as required, not <em>a</em>.
</p>

<p><strong>Matching specific characters</strong></p>
<p>There are two ways to specify what letters to match in a word, Text and GREP mode.</p>
<p>In <strong>Text mode</strong> you can simply enter a list of characters that should occur in every word, as well as up to three groups (use space- or comma-delimited lists; both character values and glyph names are fine). The idea of groups is that at least one character per group is required in each word.</p>
<p><strong>GREP mode</strong> lets you match regular expressions for more fine-grained control over the structure of the words. This uses the internal Python re module. No support on that here, please see the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax">official syntax reference</a>.
</p>


<p><strong>Options</strong></p>
<p><strong>No repeating characters</strong>: Excludes words in which any character occurs more than once.<br />
<p><strong>Output as list sorted by width</strong>: Puts every word on its own line and sorts the lines by width. The width of words is calculated taking spacing (sidebearings) and kerning into account; the latter assumes MetricsMachine-style kerning groups.</p>
